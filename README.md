# FORMULiii

### Desc: A set of economic calculators which calculate economic indicators

## How it works:

- User types numeric values into each input field on a particular calculator

  - Each input field represents a variable in the economic formula on which the calculator is basing its calculations

- The calculator stores the typed input as a piece of state, and passes this state value into the relevant function from the library of formula functions (Formulae.js).
- The Function then solves an equation based on the values which the user passed in to the input fields

## Formulae.js

- Each function in the Formulae Class (found in Formulae.js) performs an economic operation based on the appropriate economic formula, and then returns the value of the solution, rounded off to two decimal places.

## UnitsOfMeasurement.js

- An object containing various units of measurement used in the calculator components.

## CurrencyConversion.js

- (Working on it!)

## Inspiration & Accredition:

- I based my Formulae.js functionality off of economic formulae from:
  - Investopedia
  - Corporate Finance Institute (CFI)
  - Economics 101 course that I completed at Rhodes University
- My dad is involved in the education space as well as some friends of mine, so I thought it might be cool to work on something which can help within the space of education.
- An economics calculator app would have been handy while I was studying economics myself... :))
